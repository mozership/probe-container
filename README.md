# probe-container

A [Probe](https://github.com/mozership/probe) action that starts a container for the steps after it, such as the database or the mail server an API under test needs, and removes it once the run is over.

Probe downloads it the first time a workflow uses it. It needs Probe v1.27.0 or later, which calls an action once a run is over, and the `docker` command, or [another runtime](#runtimes) that takes the same arguments.

```yaml
name: Orders
actions:
  container: github.com/mozership/probe-container@<commit SHA>
jobs:
- name: orders
  steps:
  - name: Start Postgres
    id: pg
    uses: container
    with:
      image: postgres:17
      env:
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "{{vars.pg_password}}"
      ports: [5432]
      wait:
        port: 5432
    outputs:
      addr: res.addr

  - name: The table is empty to begin with
    uses: db
    with:
      dsn: "postgres://postgres:{{vars.pg_password}}@{{outputs.pg.addr}}/postgres?sslmode=disable"
      query: SELECT count(*) AS n FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public'
    test: res.rows[0].n == 0
```

The workflow gives the action a name once, under `actions`, and its steps use the name. Probe only takes a full 40-character commit SHA there. The notes of each [release](https://github.com/mozership/probe-container/releases) start with the action and its commit to copy.

A step is over once its container is started, and ready if the step has a `wait`. The container keeps running for the steps after it, in this job and in the others, and is removed, with its anonymous volumes, when the run is over: whether it passed, failed, or was ended by Ctrl+C. Nothing has to be written for that, and there is nothing to stop by hand.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `image` | String | Yes | - | The image to start |
| `command` | List | No | the command of the image | The command to run in the container, with one entry for each word, as `[redis-server, --appendonly, "yes"]` |
| `env` | Map | No | - | The environment of the container, as names and values. See [Passwords](#passwords) |
| `ports` | List | No | - | The ports of the container to reach from the machine. See [Ports](#ports) |
| `volumes` | List | No | - | What to mount, each as the runtime takes it for `--volume`, such as `/abs/path/init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql:ro` |
| `network` | String | No | the default of the runtime | The network to connect the container to. It is one that exists; the action makes none |
| `name` | String | No | one the runtime makes up | The name of the container. Two runs at once cannot both have a container of one name, so leave it out unless something needs it |
| `pull` | String | No | `missing` | When to pull the image: `missing`, `always` or `never` |
| `wait` | Map | No | - | What the container has to do before the step is over. See [Waiting](#waiting) |
| `keep` | Boolean | No | `false` | Leave the container once the run is over. See [Keeping Containers](#keeping-containers) |

The rest are options of the runtime, and are given to it as they are written. Each is left out by default.

| Parameter | Type | Option | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `add_hosts` | List | `--add-host` | Names for the container to resolve, each as `name:address`. See [Reaching the Machine](#reaching-the-machine) |
| `hostname` | String | `--hostname` | The name the container knows itself by |
| `network_aliases` | List | `--network-alias` | More names other containers on `network` reach it by. The default network of a runtime takes none |
| `dns` | List | `--dns` | The DNS servers of the container |
| `entrypoint` | String | `--entrypoint` | The executable to run in place of the entrypoint of the image. Its arguments are `command` |
| `user` | String | `--user` | Who the command runs as, as `1000` or `1000:1000` |
| `workdir` | String | `--workdir` | The directory the command runs in |
| `env_files` | List | `--env-file` | Files of `NAME=value` lines to add to the environment, each by its absolute path. See [Passwords](#passwords) |
| `labels` | Map | `--label` | Labels of the container, as names and values. `probe.run_id` and `probe.keep` are the action's |
| `platform` | String | `--platform` | The platform of the image, as `linux/amd64` |
| `tmpfs` | List | `--tmpfs` | Directories to keep in memory, as `/run` or `/tmp:size=64m` |
| `shm_size` | String | `--shm-size` | The size of `/dev/shm`, as `256m` |
| `memory` | String | `--memory` | The most memory the container may use, as `512m` |
| `cpus` | Number | `--cpus` | The most CPUs it may use, as `1.5` |
| `ulimits` | List | `--ulimit` | Limits of its processes, as `nofile=65536:65536` |
| `cap_add` | List | `--cap-add` | Capabilities to give the container, as `NET_ADMIN` |
| `cap_drop` | List | `--cap-drop` | Capabilities to take from it, as `ALL` |
| `privileged` | Boolean | `--privileged` | `true` gives the container every capability and device of the machine |
| `read_only` | Boolean | `--read-only` | `true` mounts the root of the container read-only |
| `init` | Boolean | `--init` | `true` runs an init in the container, which forwards signals and reaps processes |

A key of `with` that is not one of these fails the step before anything is started, and `probe check` reports it with its line. There is no parameter that takes any option of the runtime: a `shell` step can run the runtime itself, though nothing then removes its container.

### Ports

Each entry of `ports` is a port of the container.

| Entry | Published at |
|---|---|
| `5432` | A free port of `127.0.0.1`, which the result tells |
| `53/udp` | The same, for a protocol other than TCP: `udp` or `sctp` |
| `"8080:80"`, `"0.0.0.0:8080:80"` | Where the entry says, as the runtime takes it for `--publish` |

A port alone is the form to use: the runtime picks a port that is free, so two runs on one machine, or two jobs of one run, do not get in each other's way, and the port is not open to the network. Read where it is from the [result](#result).

### Waiting

Without `wait`, a step is over as soon as the container is started, which is before what runs in it is ready. `wait` holds the step until it is:

| Key | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `port` | Number | A TCP port of `ports` that has to take a connection and keep it. A runtime takes a connection on a published port before anything in the container listens, and closes it at once, so a connection that is only taken does not count |
| `log` | String | A [regular expression](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax) that has to match what the container wrote so far, to stdout and stderr together. It is matched against the whole log, so `(?s)ready.*ready` waits for a line that is written twice |
| `healthcheck` | Boolean | `true` waits for the health check of the image to pass. An image without one fails the step |
| `timeout` | Duration | How long to wait, as `90s` or a number of seconds. Defaults to `60s` |

When more than one is given, every one of them has to hold. The time it takes to pull the image is not part of the timeout.

The step fails when the container stops while it is waited for, or is not ready in time, and the error ends with the last lines of its log. The container is removed with the others once the run is over.

A server that takes connections before it can answer, as a database may, is better waited for by its log or its health check, or by a step after it that Probe retries.

### Reaching the Machine

A container that has to call back to the machine, such as a proxy in front of the API under test, or a server that sends webhooks to it, needs a name for the machine. `host-gateway` stands for its address:

```yaml
with:
  image: nginx:1.29
  add_hosts: ["host.docker.internal:host-gateway"]
```

Docker Desktop gives a container that name without being asked. Docker on Linux does not, so a workflow that passes on a laptop can fail in CI without it.

### Passwords

The action leaves the values of `env` out of its result and its log, which name the variables alone. Probe hides a value that is one of the workflow's `secrets` wherever it shows a step.

The values are given to the runtime as arguments, so they can be seen in the list of processes of the machine while the container is being started, and in what the runtime tells of the container afterwards. A variable of `env_files` is read by the runtime from its file, and is in no argument.

## Result

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `res.id` | String | The ID of the container |
| `res.name` | String | Its name, which another container on the same `network` reaches it by |
| `res.ports` | Map | The port on the machine for each entry of `ports`, by the port of the container: `res.ports["5432"]`, or `res.ports["53/udp"]` for a protocol other than TCP |
| `res.host` | String | The address the first entry of `ports` is reached at: `127.0.0.1`, unless the entry names another |
| `res.port` | Number | The port on the machine for the first entry of `ports` |
| `res.addr` | String | `res.host` and `res.port` together, as `127.0.0.1:51110` |
| `req` | Map | What the container was started with, with `env` as the names of its variables. An option that is empty or `false` is left out |
| `rt` | String | How long the step took, as `1.2s` |
| `status` | Number | `0` |

`res.host`, `res.port` and `res.addr` are there only when the step has `ports`.

A container that cannot be started, or that is not ready, is an error rather than a result, so the step fails whatever its `test` is.

## Keeping Containers

To look into a container after a run, such as one a test failed against, have it kept:

- `PROBE_CONTAINER_KEEP=1 probe workflow.yml` keeps every container of the run, without a change to the workflow.
- `keep: true` on a step keeps the container of that step.

Once the run is over, the action tells which containers it kept and the command that removes them:

```
[WARN]  actions.probe-container: kept containers of the run: run_id=88041310b4926f7b count=1 remove="docker rm --force --volumes $(docker ps --all --quiet --filter label=probe.run_id=88041310b4926f7b)"
[WARN]  actions.probe-container: kept container: name=sleepy_dubinsky image=postgres:17 ports=127.0.0.1:51110->5432/tcp
```

Every container the action starts has the label `probe.run_id`, with the ID of the run, and one that is kept has `probe.keep=true` as well. `docker ps --all --filter label=probe.run_id` lists what is left of every run.

## Runtimes

The action runs `docker`. `PROBE_CONTAINER_RUNTIME` names another command that takes the same arguments, such as `podman` or `nerdctl`, or the path of one:

```sh
PROBE_CONTAINER_RUNTIME=podman probe workflow.yml
```

It is read from the environment and not from a step, as it belongs to the machine and not to the workflow, and the cleanup of a run has to use the runtime its steps did.

The action uses `run`, `inspect`, `port`, `logs`, `ps` and `rm` of the runtime. It builds no image and runs nothing in a container that is already there; a `shell` step can do either with the runtime itself.

## Under a Guard

The action keeps to no guard: what runs in a container, and the hosts it connects to, are not the action's to limit. A run under `--read-only` or `--allow-host` refuses its steps, unless `--allow-action` names the action.

## What Is Left Behind

Probe calls the action once a run is over, and the action then removes every container with the label of that run. A container is left only when:

- the step or the environment asks for it to be [kept](#keeping-containers);
- Probe is killed outright, as by `kill -9`, so that it never gets to clean up;
- the runtime does not remove the container within 25 seconds, which Probe tells as a warning.

Volumes with a name, and networks, are not the action's, and stay.

## Development

```sh
go test ./...
go build -o e2e/action/probe-container . && probe e2e/workflow.yml
```

The unit tests answer from a stand-in for the runtime. The workflows under `e2e` run the action through Probe with a real one: `workflow.yml` and `healthcheck.yml` pass, `unready.yml` fails with exit status 3, and `keep.yml` leaves containers to remove by hand.
